    <h2> Abram Astle </h2>
    <p>Hey everybody! My name is Abram Astle. I'm a data science major from Blackfoot, Idaho who will be graduating pretty soon. Right now, I'm waiting to hear back from a few grad schools so that I can start working on my masters/doctorate in data science/computer science this fall. My interests as of the moment are ontological engineering, network theory, and applying Piercian semiotics to textual data.</p>
    <p> I also served a mission in Boston speaking Spanish and have been back two years. I will also be getting married to my best of friends at the start of March. (Trust me, she's awesome.)</p>
